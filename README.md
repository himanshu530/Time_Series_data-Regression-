* Predicting the sale price of bulldozers using Machine Learning
*  Main goal is to visualize the given time series data and predict the sale price of bulldozers. It is one of the challaenges on kaggle

1. Problem Definition
   Predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a "blue book" for bulldozers.

2. Data
   https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data There are 3 main datasets:

   Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.

   Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your        score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.

  Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set             determines your final rank for the competition.

3. Evaluation
   The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
